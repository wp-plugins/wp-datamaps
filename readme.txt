Generate a custom SVG map using data-binding library D3 and Datamaps.js by Mark DiMarco.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to allow users to create a custom SVG map that can then be inserted in a page or post, using the Datamaps JavaScript framework. Via the plugin's settings page 
in the Wordpress Admin, users can select the location they want pinpointed on the map, as well as editing the colors and size of the map.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-datamaps` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Map Settings' page in the Admin and set the colors and size of the map. 
4. Insert the shortcode [d3map] on the page or post where you want the map to appear.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Identify colors by their six digit hex codes.

= Can I insert multiple maps? =

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
